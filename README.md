# VNT Chat - Venturus Bootcamp

This project contains the implementation of a chat application in Angular 5. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.5 during **Venturus Bootcamp Angular**. Its main purpose is to allow the developer to learn basic Angular concepts and build a complete front-end application.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running the back-end

The back-end implementation for the chat service is built on top of Express.js and uses MongoDB as the persistence layer. It is a dummy implementation built for demonstration purposes (only to allow the app to communicate with a real server and make the Bootcamp a bit funnier for the participants!).

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
